# Configure WooCommerce Fusion

---

The first step is to create a **WooCommerce Server** document, representing your WooCommerce website.

![click on Add WooCommerce Server](images/add-wc-server.png)

Complete the "WooCommerce Server URL", "API consumer key" and "API consumer secret" fields. To find your API consumer key and secret, go to your WordPress admin panel and navigate to WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > REST API, and click on "Add key". Make sure to add Read/Write permissions to the API key.

**Settings**:
- Synchronise Sales Order Line changes back

When set, adding/removing/changing Sales Order **Lines** will be synchronised back to the WooCommerce Order (Note: Sales Orders will always be synchronised, this setting is for sync'ing changed Sales Order **Lines** *back* to WooCommerce)

- Enable Payments Sync

Let the app create Payment Entries for paid Sales Orders. A mapping of Payment Method to Bank Account is required:
```json
{
   "bacs": "1000-000 Bank Account",
   "cheque": "1000-100 Other Bank Account"
}
```
